# Friend Finder

Created during The Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension. The challenge of the assignment was to create an application mainly using Node and Express Servers. It also uses a few node packages like Express, Body-Parser, and Path. The application, FriendFinder, matches the user to their perfect match using a quick and fully comprehensive 10 question survey. 

The application is currently hosted on heroku [right here](https://still-citadel-43398.herokuapp.com/).
